### Project Title - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

### Scenario
* Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram. Developers want to deploy a new application to the AWS infrastructure.

* You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application (located in a public S3 Bucket), along with the necessary supporting software.

* This needs to be automated so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.
